         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

indeed Fee-Simple is the moſt pure holding that is, being unmixt or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in it ſelf.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:153014:24"/>
and they be diſſeized, they two cannot bring againſt the diſſeizor one Aſſize in both their names, but they muſt have againſt him two Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſizes: for every of them ought to have an Aſſize of his half, becauſe the Tenants in Common are ſeized by ſeveral titles.</p>
                  <p>But amongſt Joynt-tenants it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, for if their be never ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, and they be diſſeized, they ſhall have but one Aſſize in all their names, becauſe they have all but one joynt-title.</p>
                  <p>There is likewiſe a difference in<note place="margin">Tenants by divers Deſcents.</note> ſuing real Actions between Partners that be in divers deſcents, and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants in Common. For if a man who is ſeized in Lands in Fee dieth, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only two Daughters his Coheirs, and theſe two Daughters enter, and have each of them a Son, and dye without making any partition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, ſo that the Lands de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend equally to their two Sons, the one moyety to one of them, and the other unto the other, and they enter and enjoy the ſame in Common, and be diſſeized; they ſhall not in this caſe bring two Aſſizes, but one Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſize
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:153014:25"/>
in both their names: for though they came in by divers diſcents, yet they be Parceners, and a writ <hi>de Participatione facienda</hi> lyeth between them. Nevertheleſs, they be not Parceners by reaſon of the ſeizin and poſſeſſion which they have from their Mothers, but in reſpect to their Eſtate which deſcended to their Mothers from their Grand-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>And ſo in reſpect and conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their firſt deſcent that was to their Mothers, they have a title in Parcenery which maketh them Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceners; and they be but as one Heir to their common <hi>Anceſtor</hi> their Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, from whom the Land deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their Mothers. And therefore before partition made between them, they ſhould have but one Aſſize, though they came in by ſeveral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents.</p>
                  <p>And likewiſe in perſonal Actions, in Treſpaſs, and ſuch like caſes which concern their Tenements in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, the Tenants in Common ought to bring ſuch perſonal Actions joyntly in all their names; as for breaking their Houſes, Cloſes, or

Paſtures; waſting, treading down, or otherwiſe ſpoiling their Graſs; cutting or felling of their Woods, ſpoiling their Fruit-trees, fiſhing in their Ponds, and ſuch like. In theſe and all ſuch kind of actions wherein they are joyntly concerned, the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants in Common ſhall have one joynt Action, and recover damages joyntly.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe if two Tenants in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon make a Leaſe of their two Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements to another for term of years, reſerving unto themſelves a certain yearly Rent; if the Rent be in Arrear, they ſhall have one Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Debt for the Rent againſt the Leſſee in both their names, and not divers Actions.</p>

               <p>But touching the Sowing of Corn; if the Tenant be outed, or his term ends before it be ripe, who ſhall have the Corn I have already ſet down in the firſt <hi>Chapter,</hi> under the Title of <hi>Tenant at Will:</hi> ſor if a Tenant at Will Sowe his Land, and the Landlord put him out before the Corn be ripe, he ſhall have liberty to Reap and carry away his Corn, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:153014:48"/>
he knew not when his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord would put him out.</p>
               <p>But it is contrary with a Tenant who hath a Leaſe for years: for if his Leaſe be out before the Corn be ripe, his Landlord ſhall have it; becauſe he knew the end of his Leaſe: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if he Sowed, it is in his own wrong, unleſs there be a Covenant in his Leaſe between the Leſſor and him, that he ſhall have his way-going Crop.</p>
               <p>But if a Tenant at Will, ſet Roots, or Sowe Hemp or Flax, or any thing that brings in any yearly profit, if after the planting the Leſſor out him, or if the Leſſor dye, yet the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or his Executors ſhall have the Crop. But it is otherwiſe if he plant young Fruit-Trees, or other young Trees, as Oaks, Aſhes, or Elmes; or Sow the ground with Acorns; In this caſe if the Leſſor out him, he ſhall have none of theſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe yeeld no yearly profit at preſent.</p>
               <p>If a Tenant for life Soweth the ground, and dye before the Crop be ripe, his Executors ſhall have it; and ſo they ſhall have Graſs if it
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:153014:49"/>
be cut, but if it be <hi>unmown</hi> they ſhall not have it, for that is part of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance till it be ſevered.</p>
               <p>Every Tenant that hath an Eſtate incertain, ſhall have the corn ſown by him; though he be outed before it be ripe.</p>
               <p>If a man be ſeized in Lan <hi>Jure</hi>

               <p>But if a Woman who holds Land,<note place="margin">Hern. l. of con. p. 239.</note> 
                  <hi>Durante viduitate ſua,</hi> while ſhe continues her Widdow-hood, and Sows the ground, and marries a Husband before the Corn be ripe; here the Leſſor ſhall have the Corn, becauſe her Eſtate ends by her own act.</p>
               <p>If a man lets a Leaſe of his Wifes<note place="margin">Noys Max. p. 70.</note> Land, ſhe not joyning with him; this Leaſe is void after his death: but if the Leſſee have Sown the Land, he ſhall reap the Crop.<note place="margin">Cowel. Inſt. p. 142.</note>

               <p>There is three kinds of <hi>Eſtovers</hi> in<note place="margin">Eſtovers or Boote.</note> the Law, which is incident to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of every Tenant, whether it be for life or years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Houſe-boote,</hi> of which is two kinds; the one to repair the Houſes, the other to burn, which is called <hi>Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boote.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then there is <hi>Eſtovers,</hi> called <hi>Plough-boote;</hi> that is, ſtuffe to mend the Tenants Ploughs, Carts, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, Wayns, and making Rakes and Forks for getting in his Hay and Corn.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There is another kind of <hi>Eſtovers,</hi> called <hi>Hedge-boote;</hi> this is Timber and wood for making Gates, and Styles; and Boughs and Buſhes for mending and repairing Hedges, and Fences.</p>
               <p>So there is <hi>Eſtoverium edificandi &amp; ardendi,</hi> Houſe-boote.</p>

               <p>If a Tenant for life or years, cut<note place="margin">Co. l: 4. 31.</note> down Trees, or pull down Houſes, or ſuffer them to fall down; the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor ſhall have the Trees, and Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, of the ſaid Houſes: for the Leſſee had them only as things an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Land; and this ſeverance will not give him a greater eſtate in them.</p>
               <p>The Landlord ſhall likewiſe have

Windſals; that is, Timber-Trees blown down by Wind and Tempeſt, becauſe they are parcel of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance; ſo that the Tenant for life nor years cannot have them, unleſſe it be to build withal where Houſes are in decay.
